 * An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the Pod to exceed its resource allocation.
 *
 * To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.
