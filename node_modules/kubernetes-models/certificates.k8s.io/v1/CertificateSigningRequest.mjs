/**
 * CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.
 *
 * Kubelets use this API to obtain:
 *  1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 *  2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).
 *
 * This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.
