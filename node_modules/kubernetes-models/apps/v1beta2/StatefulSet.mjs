 * DEPRECATED - This group version of StatefulSet is deprecated by apps/v1/StatefulSet. See the release notes for more information. StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:
 *  - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.
 *  - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested.
 * The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.
